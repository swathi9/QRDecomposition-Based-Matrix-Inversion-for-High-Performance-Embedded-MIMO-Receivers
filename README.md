# QRDecomposition-Based-Matrix-Inversion-for-High-Performance-Embedded-MIMO-Receivers
Real-time matrix inversion is a key enabling technology in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications systems, such as 802.11n. To date, however, no matrix inversion implementation has been devised which supports real-time operation for these standards. In this paper, we overcome this barrier by presenting a novel matrix inversion algorithm which is ideally suited to high performance floating-point implementation. We show how the resulting architecture offers fundamentally higher performance than currently published matrix inversion approaches and we use it to create the first reported architecture capable of supporting real-time 802.11n operation. Specifically, we present a matrix inversion approach based on modified squared Givens rotations (MSGR). This is a new QR decomposition algorithm which overcomes critical limitations in other QR algorithms that prohibits their application to MIMO systems. In addition, we present a novel modification that further reduces the complexity of MSGR by almost 20%. This enables real-time implementation with negligible reduction in the accuracy of the inversion operation, or the BER of a MIMO receiver based on this.
